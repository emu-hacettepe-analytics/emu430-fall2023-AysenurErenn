Additionally, it contains special data structures that are ideal for statistical analysis, such as factors, data frames, and vectors.\nPython: Python indexes data with a base of 0. Moreover, it makes use of more conventional data structures like sets, dictionaries, and lists.\n\n\n\nR: The syntax of R is designed with statistical data analysis in mind. R code is frequently written in a way that is more functional.\nPython: Python is renowned for its readability and boasts a more versatile syntax. For code blocks, it employs indentation (whitespace).\nExample:\nIn R:\n::: {.cell}\nnums &lt;- c(16, 20, 35, 63, 78)\nmean &lt;- mean(nums)\nprint(mean)\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout} [1] 42.4 ::: :::\nIn Python:\n::: {.cell}\nnums = [16, 20, 35, 63, 78]\nmean = sum(nums) / len(nums)\nprint(mean)\n:::\n\n\n\nR: R uses specific functions and expressions for string processing.\nPython: Python provides built-in string methods and libraries for string processing.\nExample:\nIn R:\n::: {.cell}\ntext &lt;- \"Hello, World!\"\nuppercase_text &lt;- toupper(text)\n:::\nIn Python:\n::: {.cell}\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\nuppercase_text = text.upper()\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::"
